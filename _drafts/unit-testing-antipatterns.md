### Introduction

There are several articles out there that talk about unit testing anti-patterns. Most of them however deal with the low
level details of the programming code, and almost always they focus on a specific technology or programming language. 

In this article I wanted to take a step back and catalog some high-level testing anti-patterns that are technology agnostic. Hopefully you will recognize some of these patterns regardless of your favorite programming language.
