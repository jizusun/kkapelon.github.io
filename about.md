My name is Kostis Kapelonis. I am a Java developer but I also love technical writing.
Contact information can be found on [my profile page](http://codepipes.com/contact.html).


## About the content

This blog contains my own opinions on several Java related subjects. All posts are written
on my own free time. 

My contracted work can be found at my [technical writing page](http://codepipes.com). I am a professional
technical writer since 2011. I lately wrote a [Manning book](http://manning.com/kapelonis) for the [Spock testing framework](http://docs.spockframework.org/).


## About the design

This site has been created using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and the [Hyde theme](http://hyde.getpoole.com/).

Have questions, suggestions or objections? Then [ask me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/codepipes).
